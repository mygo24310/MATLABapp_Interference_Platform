# InterXplore-A MATLAB-based virtual simulation teaching platform for double-slit interference and multi-hole interference
## Introduction
InterXplore is an interactive MATLAB App designed for simulating Young's Double-Slit Interference and Multi-Hole Interference experiment, providing an intuitive platform for optics teaching and research. This app allows users to visualize the interference patterns and explore the relationship between various parameters such as light wavelength, slit width, refractive index, and more.

- **Simulate interference patterns**: Generate interference images for changing parameters such as incident light wavelength, slit width, and occlusion thickness.
- **Fringe displacement and period calculation**: Automatically calculate the fringe shift size and translation period based on user inputs.
- **Polychromatic light simulation**: Supports simulation of multi-color light spectra and free superposition of different light wavelengths.
- **Multi-Hole Interference**: Simulate interference patterns from multiple holes and visualize the resulting interference effect.
- **Interactive controls**: Real-time control of simulation parameters with sliders, dropdowns, and checkboxes.
## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your local machine, two installation and usage methods applicable to different situations will be provided below.
1. Open the Project in MATLAB(Using .mlapp files)

2. Open the Project without MATLAB(Run directly from the installer)

## System Requirements
To run **APP**, the following software and hardware are required:

- **MATLAB R2021a** or later
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later
- **Disk Space**: 10 GB available disk space
- **Memory**: Recommended to have at least **8GB RAM** for smooth operation.
