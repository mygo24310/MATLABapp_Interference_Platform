# InterXplore-A MATLAB-based virtual simulation teaching platform for double-slit interference and multi-hole interference experiment
## Introduction
InterXplore is an interactive MATLAB App designed for simulating Young's Double-Slit Interference and Multi-Hole Interference, providing an intuitive platform for optics teaching and research. This app allows users to visualize the interference patterns and explore the relationship between various parameters such as light wavelength, slit width, refractive index, and more.

- **Simulate interference patterns**: Generate interference images for changing parameters such as incident light wavelength, slit width, and occlusion thickness.
- **Fringe displacement and period calculation**: Automatically calculate the fringe shift size and translation period based on user inputs.
- **Polychromatic light simulation**: Supports simulation of multi-color light spectra and free superposition of different light wavelengths.
- **Multi-Hole Interference**: Simulate interference patterns from multiple holes and visualize the resulting interference effect.
- **Interactive controls**: Real-time control of simulation parameters with sliders, dropdowns, and checkboxes.
